# Rock paper scissors game project

**Project goals** - The goal there is to generate a random output from the rock paper scissors game with one of the options and the compare it with the users
input. The result of the compare is win, loose or a draw.

**Solution** - the random generating function is taken from the "random" python library. For input of the function are taken the three possible options(rock, paper or scissors). Then the user input is taken with if statements.
