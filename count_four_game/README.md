#Connect four game project

**Project goals** - here the goals are to choose a move that can connect four player signs by up, down, diagonal left and diagonal right to get the win.

**Solution** - the problem is solved by while loop and some functions that are with the names of what they do. In the while loop there are some exceptions that may occur in running of project. 
The functions are implemented so that they can be used repeatedly.
