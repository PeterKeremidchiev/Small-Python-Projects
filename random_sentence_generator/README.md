# Random sentence Generator project

**Project goals** - here the goals are to generate a random sentences with given words.

**Solution** - the random generating function is taken from the "random" python library and then the def function is implemented to work with the random function
which selects random words from predefined lists filled up with names, verbs, nouns etc. The def function is called up by a while loop.
