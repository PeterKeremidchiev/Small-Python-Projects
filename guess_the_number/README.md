# Guess the number project

**Project goals** - here the goals are to generate a random numbers from 1 to 100 and the user will try to guess them.

**Solution** - the random generating function is taken from the "random" python library and then the user input is taken with while loop and if statements.
The if statements are set to give a hints if the users input number is too low or too high.
